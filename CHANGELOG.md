# v1.2.0 - 06-08-2025
53 new pages of text, mostly in expanded introductions, summaries and a new cheatsheet chapter.

New or changed content:
* Each chapter now has a more expanded introduction that more clearly explains the motivation of that chapter and what you can expect in it.
* Each chapter now has an expanded "Summary: What to Remember" section with more diagrams.
* Added a new Chapter 8 Cheatsheets with several convenient overviews of diagrams, rewrite rules and constructions used in the book. Note that this changes the chapter number of all the chapters coming after.
* Expanded explanations on scalable notation. They are now briefly introduce in the Phase-free chapter, before expanded upon in the Universal Circuits chapter (Section 7.2). BREAKING CHANGE: We now represent the matrix for a collection of phase gadgets with a transpose, this makes the material using scalable notation in the Fault-tolerant computing chapter match the literature better.
* Numerous typos and small bugs fixed.
* The HTML version should now work better when the user is in darkmode.
